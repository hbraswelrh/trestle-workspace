#### Pull Request Body

The "New Pull Request" will take the changes you made to the `README.md` and place those in a history log. Then, that log will be proposed to be merged to the `main` branch of the repository.

Notice the _Write_ and _Preview_ tabs. Markdown format is present in the _Write_ tab. Check your markdown plain text using _Preview_.

> #### Leveraging GitHub Actions to author Component Definitions :octocat:

> The GitHub Actions available will allow you to create OSCAL Component Definitions using the `workflow_dispatch` functionality.

#### Related Projects 

The `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content` repository is an ongoing effort to synchronize the primary example of the `oscal-content-demo` workspace with the `ComplianceAsCode/content` data.

The project leverages GitHub Actions to automate syncing the `ComplianceAsCode/content` with the `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content`. 

> GitHub Action for [`sync-oscal-cac`](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-oscal-cac.yml)
> GitHub Action for [`sync-controls`](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-controls.yml) to create OSCAL Catalogs and Profiles using `complyscribe` and syncing ComplianceAsCode/content updated controls to the OSCAL Control Models.
> GitHub Action for [`sync-comp`](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-comp.yml) to create OSCAL Component Definitions from `complyscribe` using the `ComplianceAsCode/content` data.

##### :world_map: Steps:

1. Navigate to the Actions tab in your oscal-content-demo.
2. Click the action in the top left corner that is named [Create a Component Definition](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/oscal-content-demo/actions/workflows/create-cd.yml).
3. Click "Run workflow." There should be a box populated that requests the following inputs:
   - Name of profile in oscal-content-demo to be imported into the component definition. 
   - Name of component definition to create.
   - Name of the component in the generated component definition.
   - Type of component (e.g., service, policy, physical, validation, etc. ).
   - Description of the component in the generate component definition.
   - Filter the component definition control by a separate profile.
